# CourseVault
Learning App
Goal: This app helps people improve their skills by providing high-quality courses with a variety of learning topics. For the average person, the courses will have a small payment fee, but this is so the courses can be completely free for those in highschool or college.

Coding resources: 
Python
Flask
Javascript
HTML
CSS
AI (for code help)
SQL (for user data)



***THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT***

Development plan/structure:

This website provides online courses. Any one can create/upload their courses to this platform.

Schools:
School admins can sign up their school by entering the school name, zip code and contact info.

Students: 
Students can choose their school from the database/list in order to register as a student
Students that have done this get courses for free.

Courses:
I will create a sample course for testing, and it will contain the usual course content: Chapters, videos, a forum, and description per video. However I am planning to add a assisstant AI to help learners learn. The AI will be trained by the course creator and can help the student with course content.
I might use OLLAMA, or an OPEN-AI API-Link
